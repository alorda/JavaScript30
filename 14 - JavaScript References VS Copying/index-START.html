    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()
    team2[3] = 'Bert'
    console.log(`team2: ${team2}`)
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5[0] = null
    console.log(`team5: ${team5}`)

    const team6 = players.map(player => player)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const person = {
      name: 'Jonathan',
      age: 243
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const badCopyPerson = person
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const wellCopiedPerson = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 34, number: 26})
    console.log(wellCopiedPerson)

    const simpleCopy = Object.assign({}, person)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
